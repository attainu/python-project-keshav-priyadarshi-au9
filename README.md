## How The Program Works 


• To Organize The Junk File On The Basis Of Size :- I have used a variable(size) to store the size of the file and then checking the file size by  putting some conditions and then arranging the files into their specific folders by creating new directories as per the size of the files. All the files are first moved into "Organized Directory" then inside this folder all the other directories are created accordingly. The files which are in Bytes are stored inside a new directory called BYTES and just like that all the different files are arranged in the subsequent folders( BYTES, KB, MB, GB).

• To Organize The Junk File On The Basis Of Extension :- I have created a dictionary and saved all the possible extensions i can think of. After that checking the extension of the junk file in the computer directory and then compairing it with my created dictionary  and checking is that extension in present in dictionary ,if matched then creating the new directory named "Organized" and inside it again creating new directory  with respect to the extension name and then moving the different files in the respective directory and in case if the unknown extension is encountered than automatically a new directory named "OTHER FILES" will be created and inside that all the unknown extension files will be moved.
